MyDiscussionForum Website 

## Project Description
A forum that will allow users to discuss topics revolving around video games. Registered users will be able to post video game content and comment on posts that other registered users have submitted. Unregistered users will be able to view posts on the forum.

## Baseline Objectives

**User Requirements:**
- Browse discussions without registering
- Search posts by keywords without registering
- Register to forum by providing their name, email and image
- Log in by providing user id and password
- Create posts and comment on posts when logged in
- View and edit their profiles
- Recover password via email

**Adminstrator Requirements:**
- Search user by name, email, or post
- Enable and disable users
- Edit and remove post items or complete posts

**Functional Requirements:**
- Hand-styled layout with contextual menus (i.e. when user has logged on to site, menus reflect change). Layout frameworks are not permitted other than Bootstrap (see above).
- 2 or 3 column layout using appropriate design principles (i.e. highlighting nav links when hovered over, etc) responsive design
- Form validation with JavaScript
- Server-side scripting with PHP
- Data storage in MySQL
- Appropriate security for data
- Site must maintain state (user state being logged on, etc)
- Responsive design philosophy (minimum requirements for different non-mobile display sizes)
- AJAX (or similar) utilization for asynchronous updates (meaning that if a discussion thread is updated, another user who is viewing the same thread will not have to refresh the page to see the update)
- User images (thumbnail) and profile stored in database
- Simple discussion (topics) grouping and display
- Navigation breadcrumb strategy (i.e. user can determine where they are in threads)
- Error handling (bad navigation)

**Additional Requirements:**
- Search and analysis by topic/thread
- Collapsible items/treads without page reloading
- Alerts on page changes
- Styling flourishes
